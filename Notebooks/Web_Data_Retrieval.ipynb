The pre-tournament favourite team or an athlete winning a title could be taken for granted while failure could attract intense criticism. India was in this unenviable situation.\\n\\nBut over the last three weeks, the Men in Blue have gone about their business clinically and methodically to emerge triumphant after beating New Zealand by four wickets in a pulsating summit clash at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium on Sunday.\\n\\nThe victory, though, did not come easy. India had one of the most balanced squad in the competition, and the flexibility and depth in every position was unparalleled. Against a dogged Black Caps unit, Rohit Sharma’s men had to dig into the last ounce of talent in its dugout to cross the final hurdle.\\n\\nIn pursuit of 252, Rohit (76) took the bull by its horns and pulled the second ball of the chase from Kyle Jamieson for a six.\\n\\nOver the next hour, in a stroke-filled display of power-hitting, he charged down to the pacers, smashed forcefully through the off-side and even brought out the lap-shot en route his first half-century of the competition.\\n\\nAlso read | Virat Kohli’s reaction after India’s win in Champions Trophy final\\n\\nHowever, three quick wickets, including Rohit’s, saw India go from 105 for no loss to 122 for three. But the in-form Shreyas Iyer, as he had done a few times in this event, soaked up the pressure and stroked a vital 48 mixing caution and aggression.\\n\\nKnown for his prowess against spin, the Mumbai batter looked in control during his knock, using his feet well to hit a few mighty sixes whenever the asking rate creeped up.\\n\\nHe found good support from Axar Patel as they stitched a 61-run stand for the fourth wicket. The Kiwi spinners, led by off-spinner Michael Bracewell (two for 28), though, did not throw in the towel and removed the set batters to keep the match evenly poised.\\n\\nFortunately for India, K.L. Rahul (34 n.o.) eased the nerves of a billion fans with another measured knock and Ravindra Jadeja, whose brilliant spell helped restrict New Zealand to a modest total, fittingly hit the winning runs with a boundary through the leg side.\\n\\nEarlier, the Kiwis managed 251 for seven after electing to bat, riding on half-centuries from Daryl Mitchell (63) and Bracewell (53 n.o.).\\n\\nFor the umpteenth time, the Indian spinners dominated the middle-overs and squeezed the runs dry. The spin quartet sent in 38 overs and gave away only 144 runs while taking five wickets.\\n\\nRachin Ravindra got off to a flyer in the PowerPlay as the Kiwis raced to 69 for one. The southpaw cut loose against Hardik Pandya smashing him for a six and two fours in the fourth over. He then pocketed a brace of boundaries off Mohammed Shami, forcing Rohit to bring his trump card, Varun Chakaravarthy, to bowl the sixth. The mystery spinner duly delivered in his second over, trapping Will Young leg-before.\\n\\nKuldeep Yadav then forced the brakes by striking twice in his first two overs. The left-arm wrist spinner castled Ravindra off his first ball with a wrong one, and had Kane Williamson caught and bowled.\\n\\nOn a pitch that did not offer much turn, Jadjea and Axar were impeccably accurate, targeting the stumps and further tightened the screws through their miserly spells.\\n\\nTowards the end, Bracewell gave the innings much-needed momentum as the Black Caps managed 79 in the last 10 overs to reach a respectable score. But on a day when India’s batting depth came to the fore, it proved to be a few runs short.\\n\\nComments\\n\\nRelated stories\\n\\nIndia vs New Zealand ICC Champions Trophy 2025 Final match in pictures\\n\\nChampions Trophy 2025: Rachin Ravindra wins Player of the Tournament award\\n\\nRelated Topics\\n\\nChampions Trophy 2025 /\\n\\nICC Champions Trophy /\\n\\nIndia /\\n\\nNew Zealand /\\n\\nIndia vs New Zealand /\\n\\nRohit Sharma\\n\\nLatest on Sportstar\\n\\nLive Blog 2025-03-09T22:04:46+05:30\\n\\nIndia wins ICC Champions Trophy LIVE reactions: PM Modi, Sachin Tendulkar wish Men in Blue for third title\\n\\nTeam Sportstar\\n\\nIND vs NZ: India beats New Zealand by four wickets, claims third Champions Trophy title\\n\\nS.

The umpires walk out to the middle. New Zealand's skipper Mitchell Santner is leading the pep-talk in the huddle, near the ropes before the Black Caps take the field. Rohit Sharma and Shubman Gill are the openers for India as they walk to the pitch. Kyle Jamieson to kickoff the proceedings with the new ball for New Zealand. Off we go...\\n\\nto , ... THE RUN CHASE ...\\n\\nto , Are these runs enough? Well, in any finale, one might say New Zealand have enough runs to defend. But given how the Indian batting unit has performed in unison, will the Kiwi bowlers be able to create history? Remember, they are short of Matt Henry, their experienced pacer whose absence might be felt during the new-ball phase. But it all comes down to how quickly New Zealand get those breakthroughs. With the pitch expected to slow down further, the task is up the sleeves of the spinners then. Will India get hands to the silverware after a 12 year long wait? Or will the fortunes be with New Zealand? The Kiwis have got the better of India, particularly in the ICC knockouts, be it the ICC 2019 World Cup semifinal, or the World Test Championship Final of 2021. And they will come out to defend with that motivation, also with an aim to win the Champions Trophy title after 25 years. Run chase up in a bit. Stay tuned.\\n\\nto , Varun Chakravarthy is in for a chat. He says it's a good wicket compared to the last game and it is not turning much. Mentions that his plan was to stick to the stumps and wait for the batters to make mistakes. States that he enjoys bowling both in the Powerplay and at the death, as it's more challenging and gives him opportunities to pick up wickets. He admits he's still pretty new to the setup but loves bowling alongside the rest of the spin quartet. On the blow he took to the right leg while attempting to stop the ball, he says he's feeling a little sore and has needed a few painkillers to push through. As for the target, he believes it is a gettable score if they bat well.\\n\\nto , The pitch wasn't actually that tricky as the ball only turned about 2 degrees on average, less than any other game at this venue. But India's spinners were super disciplined, hitting good lengths and keeping the ball at the stumps while mixing up their pace. This forced the Kiwi batters to play forward uncomfortably, taking them out of their comfort zone. And to further prove our point, the spinners bowled 38 overs in total, and conceded 144 runs, while sharing 5 wickets among them. The batters found a bit easy to score runs against the seamers as Shami and Hardik bowled 12 overs combined and conceded 104 runs.\\n\\nto , As they headed into the death overs with the score still not in the threatening territory, they desperately needed someone to step up. Bracewell did provide some decent support when called upon, but the turning point came when Mitchell fell at the worst possible moment - right when he'd finally made the decision to abandon caution after his fifty. However, Bracewell took off against the pacers, smashing some quick important runs. His crucial cameo of 53 off 40 helped New Zealand to get past the 250-run mark, with New Zealand scoring 79 runs in the last ten overs.\\n\\nto , With Latham's wicket after a boundary-less 33-run partnership with Mitchell, India tried to hold the bull by its horn and further press on the scoring rate. However, the in-form number 6 in Glenn Phillips played a responsible hand and found quick boundaries to get back the rhythm. But Mitchell remained cautious at the other end. Their 57-run partnership ended when Chakravarthy dismissed Phillips with an exceptional delivery. Overall, during the second Powerplay (11-40), New Zealand struggled against the trial by India's spin quad, scoring just 103 runs and lost four wickets while managing to hit just three boundaries in this entire phase.\\n\\nto , With the Dubai pitch showing its typical character, the ball stuck in the surface on several occasions - Williamson's dismissal being exhibit A. Daryl Mitchell and Latham gradually adjusted to the pace of the pitch. Meanwhile, India's bowlers strategically targeted lengths that neutralized the pair's effective sweep shots - a productive run-scoring weapon for both. A proper tactical arm-wrestle was developing out in the middle overs.\\n\\nto , Rohit, judicious to spot the spinners creating trouble, cleverly brought spin from both ends to put the brakes on with fresh batters at the crease, looking for a rebuild. The Kiwis had certainly made hay while the sun shone against the new ball, helped along by a few butter-fingered moments in the field and some extras. But once the spinners got into their rhythm, they wrestled back control during those middle overs, turning the screws on.\\n\\nto , New Zealand started brightly, with Rachin Ravindra and Will Young showing good patience against India's pace attack. The pitch seemed to offer decent batting conditions, all things considered. Ravindra took the more aggressive approach, consistently finding boundaries to put India under pressure, while Young played a solid supporting role. The Black Caps were cruising gently above run-a-ball. However, the introduction of spin changed the complexion completely. Varun Chakravarthy struck first by removing Young, and shortly after, Kuldeep Yadav dismissed the dangerous-looking Ravindra and Kane Williamson, who was relatively new to the pitch. What had been a comfortable 57/0 quickly deteriorated to 75/3.\\n\\nto , New Zealand just manage to stretch past the 250-run mark in the end, courtesy off a pivotal cameo from Michael Bracewell, just when the chips were down. Remember, this is the same pitch where the India vs Pakistan match was played, and 241 was the total scored in the first innings. So, it's just around in that territory. Overall, it was a brilliant bowling display by the Indian spin quartet, but also to be fair, India looked the shade of the fielding standards that define them.\\n\\n50\\n\\nover\\n\\n50 | 12 Runs | HH: 251/7\\n\\n49.6\\n\\nMohammad Shami to Michael Bracewell, Another yorker, on off, Michael Bracewell digs it in front of deep cover where Axar Patel fails to pick it up cleanly and that allows the second run to be completed with ease. New Zealand end at 251/7!\\n\\n49.5\\n\\nMohammad Shami to Michael Bracewell, FIFTY for Michael Bracewell! What a brilliant cameo this has been for New Zealand! Walking in at a tricky phase, Bracewell has managed to inject some much-needed momentum into the innings. A valuable knock under pressure! Full and on off, Bracewell shuffles across and scoops it past backward square leg for a couple of runs to get to the milestone.\\n\\n49.4\\n\\nMohammad Shami to Nathan Smith, Superb delivery! A pinpoint yorker, right at the toes, angling in, Nathan Smith looks to flick but misses and falls over as the ball crashes his shoes and goes to short fine leg. The batters steal a leg bye.\\n\\n49.3\\n\\nMohammad Shami to Michael Bracewell, Shami sees the batter shuffle across and bowls a full toss, following him, Michael Bracewell hits it to long off for a single.\\n\\n49.2\\n\\nMohammad Shami to Michael Bracewell, Full and outside off, Michael Bracewell drags it to long on for a couple of runs.\\n\\n49.1\\n\\nMohammad Shami to Michael Bracewell, FOUR! Not a bad ball but just a better shot to get four runs. Shami goes full and outside off, Michael Bracewell opens the bat face and steers it to the right of deep third. Ravindra Jadeja moves across in a flash and tries to stick his boot in the way but the ball goes past it to crash into the ropes.\\n\\nto , Nathan Smith walks in but it will be Michael Bracewell on strike at the start of the over. Shami will close out the innings for India. Can New Zealand get to 250? It would give them a psychological edge heading into the break.\\n\\n49\\n\\nover\\n\\n49 | 12 Runs | HH: 239/7\\n\\n48.6\\n\\nHardik Pandya to Mitchell Santner, OUT! RUN OUT! A good throw from Virat Kohli leads to a wicket! Hardik Pandya goes into the deck again, short of a length, on middle, Mitchell Santner pulls it to deep mid-wicket. Gets the first run with ease but sets off for the second to get Bracewell back on strike for the next over. Virat Kohli collects the ball in a swift motion and fires a throw to the keeper KL Rahul on a bounce and he knocks the bails. Mitchell Santner drags his bat but the throw is just too good catching him short of the crease.\\n\\nto , Is Mitchell Santner short of his crease? The third umpire is called into action, and the replays confirm that despite the desperate stretch, the Kiwi skipper is caught short!\\n\\n48.5\\n\\nHardik Pandya to Mitchell Santner, Hardik takes some pace off with a roll off the fingers over the ball and drops it short, just outside off, Mitchell Santner is way too early on the pull and misses.\\n\\n48.4\\n\\nHardik Pandya to Mitchell Santner, Full and on middle, Mitchell Santner chips it through mid-wicket for a couple of runs.\\n\\n48.3\\n\\nHardik Pandya to Michael Bracewell, Top effort from Rohit Sharma!

Starts with a short one, that's just a bit too short and well outside off. Mitchell Santner drops his wrists on this one.\\n\\nto , With two left-handers at the crease, Rohit Sharma might be reluctant to bring on Axar Patel. Bowling Hardik Pandya here makes much more sense, and Rohit does exactly that. Hardik has bowled just two overs so far, conceding 18 runs.\\n\\n48\\n\\nover\\n\\n48 | 11 Runs | HH: 227/6\\n\\n47.6\\n\\nMohammad Shami to Michael Bracewell, A low full toss, outside off, Michael Bracewell goes hard at it and thumps it to deep point for a couple of runs.\\n\\n47.5\\n\\nMohammad Shami to Michael Bracewell, FOUR!

Shami goes full but lands it well outside the tramline on off.

CAUGHT! One shot too many from Daryl Mitchell and Mohammad Shami gets his name on the wickets column. A big blow to New Zealand at the wrong time! Shami goes full this time and keeps it just outside off, Daryl Mitchell clears his front leg out and looks to power it over the infield on the off side but doesn't quite get underneath the ball. Hits it off the cue end of the bat and over cover. Rohit Sharma backtracks a bit and takes a good catch over his head. Daryl Mitchell departs for a fighting 63 off 101 balls and New Zealand are 211/6.\\n\\n45.3\\n\\nMohammad Shami to Daryl Mitchell, FOUR!

Shami drops it short and on middle, sits up perfectly for Daryl Mitchell who pulls it over mid-wicket for a boundary.\\n\\nto , Varun Chakaravarthy has walked off the field after completing his spell.

A much-needed productive over for New Zealand. 12 runs off it.\\n\\n43.5\\n\\nMohammad Shami to Michael Bracewell, SIX! New Zealand need many more of these! Shami digs it in short but it is not short enough to trouble the batter, on off, Bracwell stands tall and pummels it over deep mid-wicket for a six.\\n\\n43.4\\n\\nMohammad Shami to Michael Bracewell, Hurls it on the fuller side, on middle, Michael Bracewell swipes it to the right of deep square leg. Shreyas Iyer gets around to his right and mops it up.

On a back of a length, on the pads, Bracewell has a swipe across the line but misses. The ball goes under the bat to hit the pads. A leg bye is taken as the ball rolls off the pads in front of backward point.\\n\\n43.1\\n\\nMohammad Shami to Michael Bracewell, Begins on a good length from over the wicket, on middle, Michael Bracewell pushes it to mid off.\\n\\nto , Surprisingly, this pitch has offered the least turn of all games played here so far. The numbers back it up, just 2 degrees of average turn today, significantly lower than what we've seen in previous matches here. With that said, Mohammad Shami comes back into the attack.\\n\\n43\\n\\nover\\n\\n43 | 6 Runs | HH: 184/5\\n\\n42.6\\n\\nKuldeep Yadav to Michael Bracewell, Back to bowling it flat and short, on middle, Michael Bracewell knocks it down to long on for a single.\\n\\n42.5\\n\\nKuldeep Yadav to Michael Bracewell, Serves the googly now, on off, on a length, Michael Bracewell lunges to smother the spin.

A slight scare, but he seems ready to continue.\\n\\n41.3\\n\\nVarun Chakaravarthy to Daryl Mitchell, Fired in, full and on off, Daryl Mitchell gets behind the line and hammers it down the deck.

THROUGH THE GATES! BOWLED'EM! What a tournament Varun Chakaravarthy is having! Gets his second wicket and snags a big fish! Bowls the googly from over the stumps and gets the ball to drift into the batter, on a flatter trajectory. The line of attack is in front of the stumps on a fractional fuller length, with the ball skidding on quickly. Glenn Phillips tries to access the cut shot but misses and plays over the wrong line. The ball sneaks between the bat and pad to break the stumps. Phillips falls for 34 (52). The 57-run stand is broken.

India have applied the spin squeeze in the middle overs, just as they have all tournament. The boundaries have dried up, and all four spinners have been spot on with their lines and lengths, building pressure with a heap of dot balls. However, they haven't helped their cause in the field, with Rachin Ravindra dropped twice earlier, and now one chance going down against both Phillips and Mitchell. Glenn Phillips has managed to find a couple of boundaries since arriving at the crease and has tried to be busy. Daryl Mitchell is still searching for fluency but having faced 76 balls, he must hang in there, pick the right moment, and time his acceleration wisely to make his start count.\\n\\n36\\n\\nover\\n\\n36 | 3 Runs | HH: 156/4\\n\\n35.6\\n\\nRavindra Jadeja to Glenn Phillips, DROPPED AGAIN!

Ravindra Jadeja is not happy as he thinks that it should have been caught. But fairly, a difficult chance. The batters rotate their strike in the meantime.\\n\\n35.5\\n\\nRavindra Jadeja to Daryl Mitchell, Tossed up at 93.4 kph, on a fuller length, around off, Daryl Mitchell lunges forward and drives it down to long off for a single.\\n\\n35.4\\n\\nRavindra Jadeja to Daryl Mitchell, Fuller and quicker, on middle, hit back to the bowler.\\n\\n35.3\\n\\nRavindra Jadeja to Daryl Mitchell, Nice and full, on middle, pushed to mid-wicket.\\n\\n35.2\\n\\nRavindra Jadeja to Glenn Phillips, Good length, on the middle and leg, glanced away to deep square leg.

After a solid start, New Zealand have suddenly found themselves in trouble, losing three big wickets in quick succession, handing India a crucial advantage heading into the middle overs. This is where India’s spinners thrive, and they’ll be eager to tighten the screws even further. Despite the early blows, the Kiwis still have a platform to rebuild, thanks to their openers. They’ll need a steady partnership now to weather the storm and adjust to the pace of the wicket. On the other hand, India will stay on the attack, knowing that one or two more breakthroughs could tilt this final heavily in their favour. The next phase of play is crucial for both teams!\\n\\n15\\n\\nover\\n\\n15 | 2 Runs | HH: 83/3\\n\\n14.6\\n\\nKuldeep Yadav to Daryl Mitchell, Another googly, full and on off, Daryl Mitchell plays it with a straight bat to long off for a single.\\n\\n14.5\\n\\nKuldeep Yadav to Daryl Mitchell, Out comes the googly but the batter picks it, on middle, on a nagging length, Mitchell blocks it out with his bat out in front.\\n\\n14.4\\n\\nKuldeep Yadav to Daryl Mitchell, Looped up, slower and fuller, on middle, Daryl Mitchell turns it with the spin to mid-wicket.\\n\\n14.3\\n\\nKuldeep Yadav to Daryl Mitchell, This goes straight on, shorter and quicker, on off, Daryl Mitchell goes on the back foot and punches it back to Kuldeep.\\n\\n14.2\\n\\nKuldeep Yadav to Daryl Mitchell, At 83.1 kph, going across, on off, Daryl Mitchell gets forward to stab it down on the off side.\\n\\n14.1\\n\\nKuldeep Yadav to Tom Latham, Drops it short, on off, Tom Latham rocks back and punches it through mid on for a single.\\n\\n14\\n\\nover\\n\\n14 | 4 Runs | HH: 81/3\\n\\n13.6\\n\\nAxar Patel to Daryl Mitchell, Pushed through this time a bit quicker and shorter, on the pads, Daryl Mitchell goes on the back foot to nudge it to mid-wicket.\\n\\n13.5\\n\\nAxar Patel to Daryl Mitchell, Full and on off, Daryl Mitchell taps it to the left of the bowler.\\n\\n13.4\\n\\nAxar Patel to Daryl Mitchell, Flat and short, on middle, clipped to mid-wicket off the back foot.\\n\\n13.3\\n\\nAxar Patel to Daryl Mitchell, Keeps it full and straight, on middle, Daryl Mitchell pushes it back to the bowler.\\n\\n13.2\\n\\nAxar Patel to Daryl Mitchell, FOUR!

Floated up by Kuldeep from over the wicket, on off, on a length, Kane Williamson plants his front foot across and gets his bat in front of the front pad. Tries to play it with the turn but the ball stops a bit on him. Ends up chipping it tamely to the right of Kuldeep, who makes no mistake.

Rachin Ravindra departs for a well-made 37 (29) and New Zealand are 69/2.\\n\\nto , End of Powerplay 1! A solid start for New Zealand.

Will Young is a bit late on the shot as he looks to flick and also gets across as the ball drifts into the batter. Misses to get any bat on it and the ball beats the inside edge before pinging on the front pad. Actually, the bat crashed on his front foot and hence, didn't get in the line of the ball.

Two taken.\\n\\n7.1\\n\\nVarun Chakaravarthy to Rachin Ravindra, WIDE! An appeal for caught behind and up goes the finger. Rachin Ravindra however, reviews it straightaway! Varun Chakaravarthy pushes it to the leg stump line and darts it on the fullish length, Rachin Ravindra sits down on his knee and looks to sweep it away, but is beaten by the pace. The ball passes very close to the bat and the gloves. A good reaction grab by KL Rahul behind the stumps. He appeals and it is given out.

He is ready to resume.\\n\\n6.3\\n\\nMohammad Shami to Rachin Ravindra, PUT DOWN! Shami straightaway calls the physio! Fuller and on the stumps, Rachin Ravindra chips it straight towards the bowler in the air. Mohammad Shami tries to snaffle it on his follow-through over his left shoulder, with a reverse cup. He loses sight of the ball as he gets both his hands right in front of his eyes, and the ball gets parried away off his fingers to the mid on region for a single. Rohit Sharma looks a bit disappointed there.\\n\\n6.2\\n\\nMohammad Shami to Rachin Ravindra, An appeal for LBW, but not entertained by the umpire Richard Illingworth. Height probably? Rohit Sharma thinks for a bit, and chats with Hardik Pandya on the way, but decides not to opt for a review. On a good length, skidding through on middle, Rachin Ravindra goes for the pull shot, but picks the wrong length and is beaten on the inside edge, getting rapped on the body.\\n\\n6.1\\n\\nMohammad Shami to Rachin Ravindra, Bowls from a wider angle from around the stumps. Hits the hard length, angling on middle, Rachin Ravindra tucks it to mid on.\\n\\nover\\n\\n6 | 9 Runs | HH: 46/0\\n\\n5.6\\n\\nVarun Chakaravarthy to Will Young, Fuller and on the legs, Will Young sweeps it a bit uppishly but it lands on the bounce towards Kuldeep Yadav at short fine leg.\\n\\n5.5\\n\\nVarun Chakaravarthy to Rachin Ravindra, Angling on the stumps, on a good length, Rachin Ravindra whips it across wide of mid-wicket and rotates the strike.\\n\\n5.4\\n\\nVarun Chakaravarthy to Rachin Ravindra, Length, on off, cut away to backward point.\\n\\n5.3\\n\\nVarun Chakaravarthy to Rachin Ravindra, Dropped fuller and on the stumps, Rachin Ravindra sweeps it to deep square leg. Shreyas Iyer from deep mid-wicket moves to his left and intercepts the ball. He almost goes over the ropes with the momentum, but lobs the ball before and saves two for his side.\\n\\n5.2\\n\\nVarun Chakaravarthy to Rachin Ravindra, Around the stumps and a slip in place. Flat, full and outside off. Rachin Ravindra opts out of the shot.\\n\\n5.1\\n\\nVarun Chakaravarthy to Will Young, Good length, on middle and leg, worked across to deep square leg for a single.\\n\\n5.1\\n\\nVarun Chakaravarthy to Will Young, FIVE WIDES! Beats the keeper and goes away! Flatter and quicker, but down leg, Will Young tries to work it across to the leg side, but misses. The keeper is a bit blinded by the batter and misses collecting the ball to his left. It races away to the deep fine leg fence.\\n\\nto , Time for some early spin? Indeed. Varun Chakaravarthy has been introduced into the attack, replacing Hardik Pandya.\\n\\nover\\n\\n5 | 11 Runs | HH: 37/0\\n\\n4.6\\n\\nMohammad Shami to Will Young, Angling onto the pads now, on a hard length, Will Young whips it along the ground to deep backward square leg for a single. Another good over for New Zealand. 16 from the previous, and 11 from this one. 27 from the last two overs.\\n\\n4.5\\n\\nMohammad Shami to Will Young, Very full, on off and middle, Young pats his front foot ahead and pushes it to mid on.\\n\\n4.4\\n\\nMohammad Shami to Rachin Ravindra, A yard behind fuller length, on off, driven through covers for a quick single.\\n\\n4.3\\n\\nMohammad Shami to Rachin Ravindra, EDGED AND FOUR! No third man and it races away! A flurry of boundaries for the Kiwis! Shami changes the angle and comes from around the wickets. Hits the hard length, on off, Rachin Ravindra brings the bat straight in front to block, but the ball nips away a shy bit and goes off the outside edge to deep third for a boundary.\\n\\n4.2\\n\\nMohammad Shami to Rachin Ravindra, FOUR! Rachin Ravindra is on a roll now! What a crafty wristwork that! Fuller and angling away on off from middle, Rachin Ravindra brings his bottom hand into play and flicks it gorgeously between mid on and mid-wicket for a boundary.\\n\\n4.1\\n\\nMohammad Shami to Will Young, Fuller and slightly outside off. Will Young hops on the back foot and taps it between backward point and short third for a quick run.\\n\\nover\\n\\n4 | 16 Runs | HH: 26/0\\n\\n3.6\\n\\nHardik Pandya to Rachin Ravindra, FOUR! And again! One bounce, over the ropes! Short again from Hardik, a bit too predictable, on the bodyline. Rachin Ravindra shapes up for the pull shot on the back foot and swings through. Clears the in-field over square leg for a boundary. 16 off the over.\\n\\n3.6\\n\\nHardik Pandya to Rachin Ravindra, WIDE! Down leg, too short. Rachin dodges away. Wide called.\\n\\n3.5\\n\\nHardik Pandya to Rachin Ravindra, FOUR! Power first, and elegance this time! Back of a length, offered outside off, Rachin Ravindra rides the bounce and cuts it past backward point for a boundary.\\n\\n3.4\\n\\nHardik Pandya to Rachin Ravindra, SIX! That is a genuinely good strike! The first six of the Finale! Hardik bangs it hard and short on the pitch, on off, Rachin Ravindra weighs on the back foot, shapes up well and belts it over deep mid-wicket for a cracking six.\\n\\n3.3\\n\\nHardik Pandya to Will Young, Slants it on the pads, on a good length, Young glances it off the back foot to deep fine leg. Rotates the strike with a single.\\n\\n3.2\\n\\nHardik Pandya to Will Young, Tails back in from off, on a length, Will Young brings his bat straight down and knocks it to mid on.\\n\\n3.1\\n\\nHardik Pandya to Will Young, Wide outside off, full in length, Young leaves this harmless delivery.\\n\\nover\\n\\n3 | 4 Runs | HH: 10/0\\n\\n2.6\\n\\nMohammad Shami to Rachin Ravindra, Nice and full, on the stumps, Rachin respects it and blocks it on the pitch.\\n\\n2.5\\n\\nMohammad Shami to Will Young, Quick call! Fuller and straighter, outside off, Young presses forward and pushes it to widish mid off and scoots to the other end. The fielder throws to the bowler's end but misses. A single taken, a bit risky though.\\n\\n2.4\\n\\nMohammad Shami to Will Young, BEATEN! This one lands on a good length and nips back sharply into the right-hander. Will Young tries to play on the up to the off side but is beaten by the angle on the inside edge.\\n\\n2.3\\n\\nMohammad Shami to Will Young, Goes fuller on the middle and leg, Will Young clips it along the ground to deep square leg. Hardik Pandya in the deep moves across to his left and restricts the batters to two.\\n\\n2.2\\n\\nMohammad Shami to Rachin Ravindra, Good length, around off, guided off the outer half of the bat to deep third for one.\\n\\n2.1\\n\\nMohammad Shami to Rachin Ravindra, Another fumble from Kohli, but no run taken! Length, across off, Rachin punches it on the front foot to short cover, where the ball evades Kohli, but Gill from mid off backs it up well to his right.\\n\\nover\\n\\n2 | 2 Runs | HH: 6/0\\n\\n1.6\\n\\nHardik Pandya to Will Young, Jagging back into the right-hander, on a length, Will Young is taken aback by that extra bit of bounce and the ball deflects off his gloves, before rolling near the strip, to the off side. Good tidy over from Hardik Pandya.\\n\\n1.5\\n\\nHardik Pandya to Rachin Ravindra, Off the mark, is Rachin Ravindra! Hard length, outside off, Rachin Ravindra gets forward and punches it with soft hands to the cover region, and steals a quick single as Kohli fumbles a bit to pick that on his left. Good coordination between the two batters.\\n\\n1.4\\n\\nHardik Pandya to Rachin Ravindra, Nipping back into the batter, on a length, on middle, Rachin Ravindra punches it to mid off.\\n\\n1.3\\n\\nHardik Pandya to Rachin Ravindra, Back of a length, on top of off, Rachin watches it closely and plays it close to the body getting half-forward. Defends it out.\\n\\n1.2\\n\\nHardik Pandya to Rachin Ravindra, On the stumps, on a good length, Rachin Ravindra gets right behind it and taps it out to the off side.\\n\\n1.1\\n\\nHardik Pandya to Rachin Ravindra, Corrects the line now, full and across off, Rachin Ravindra offers no shot at it.\\n\\n1.1\\n\\nHardik Pandya to Rachin Ravindra, WIDE! Pandya starts off with a loosener! Swinging down the leg stump line, Rachin misses to flick. Wide called.\\n\\nto , Hardik Pandya will take the other new ball from the opposite end. Pandya will start from over the wicket and has a slip in place.\\n\\nover\\n\\n1 | 4 Runs | HH: 4/0\\n\\n0.6\\n\\nMohammad Shami to Will Young, FOUR! New Zealand and Will Young are underway in the finale! A controlled cut! Shami offers some width, shaping away from off, on a good length. Will Young waits for it, weighing on the back foot and places it between cover and point for a boundary. 4/0 are NZ after the first over.\\n\\n0.5\\n\\nMohammad Shami to Will Young, Hits the deck hard does Shami, at 136 kph, just outside off, Will Young responds with a solid back foot punch to the cover-point region.\\n\\n0.4\\n\\nMohammad Shami to Will Young, On the pads now, on a hard length, Young tries to nudge it across into the leg side, but misses and gets rapped on the thigh pad.\\n\\n0.3\\n\\nMohammad Shami to Will Young, Gentle outswinger on off, full in length, Young gets on the front foot and pushes it firmly to mid off.\\n\\n0.2\\n\\nMohammad Shami to Will Young, Another one that shapes away from outside off, touch fuller in length, Will Young checks the delivery before leaving it alone.\\n\\n0.1\\n\\nMohammad Shami to Will Young, BEATEN! Shami begins on the money and beats the bat's edge straightaway! Accurate seam position, swinging away from off, on a length, Will Young gets on the front foot to block but plays inside the line and the ball whistles past the outside edge.\\n\\nto , The anthems are done, the wait is over, and the stage is set. Countless hours of hard work and preparation have led to this very moment. The stands are awash with blue, as one would expect, but the Kiwi fans, though outnumbered, will be eager to make their voices heard and rally behind their team. Rohit Sharma leads his troops out to the centre. Out walk the two openers of New Zealand, Will Young and Rachin Ravindra. Mohammad Shami will kickstart proceedings with the new ball for the Men in Blue. Shami to Young first up. A slip in place. Let the battle begin!\\n\\nto , The giant flags of both nations have been rolled out, and it's time for the national anthems before the start of the grand finale. The match officials lead the way, followed by Rohit Sharma and Mitchell Santner, who march their respective teams out for this momentous occasion. It will be New Zealand's national anthem first, followed by that of India.\\n\\nto , The captain of India, Rohit Sharma, says that they don't mind batting second here as they have batted first and bowled first previously in these conditions. Says they have chased well in the previous game and adds that at the end of the day, all that matters is how well they play and are not worrying too much about the result. Expects the boys to play good cricket. Admits that New Zealand has been a good team in recent times and says they have done well in the ICC tournaments. Says the challenge for them is to play well against them and concludes by informing that they are going with the same side.\\n\\nto , Mitchell Santner, the skipper of New Zealand says it looks like a very good wicket, and they will look to add runs on the board and see how it goes. Mentions it's a big occasion and they are ready for the challenge. Says that having played a game here already gives them a fair idea and is different to what they got in Pakistan, but they want to get runs on the board and then hope for the pitch to slow down. Mentions that different guys have stepped up at different times and this is going to be a good game. Informs that Matt Henry misses out due to the injury and Nathan Smith comes in place for him.\\n\\nto , New Zealand (Playing XI) - Will Young, Rachin Ravindra, Kane Williamson, Daryl Mitchell, Tom Latham (WK), Glenn Phillips, Michael Bracewell, Mitchell Santner (C), Nathan Smith (In for Matt Henry), Kyle Jamieson, Will O'Rourke.\\n\\nto , India (Unchanged Playing XI) - Rohit Sharma (C), Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer, Axar Patel, KL Rahul (WK), Hardik Pandya, Ravindra Jadeja, Mohammad Shami, Kuldeep Yadav, Varun Chakaravarthy.\\n\\nto , TOSS - Mitchell Santner calls it correctly and New Zealand have opted to BAT first.\\n\\nto , PITCH REPORT - Ramiz Raja is near the deck. He starts by saying that it is a bit warm today and there is also a bit of cloud cover. Mentions that the square boundaries are equidistant at 66 meters, while the straight hit is a solid 76 meters. Aaron Finch joins him and says that the surface looks extremely dry. Tells that this is the same surface which was used for the India-Pakistan clash. Reckons that winning the toss and batting first seems the way to go, as it will only get harder to bat as the game progresses. Feels that as an opener, the ball could skid on areas without grass, making stroke play tricky early on.\\n\\nto , Visuals from the Kiwi camp show Matt Henry undergoing a fitness test, and it doesn’t look promising. The pacer appears to be wincing after every delivery. After completing the test, he looks distraught and receives a consoling pat on the back from New Zealand bowling coach Jacob Oram. This could be a massive blow to the Black Caps ahead of the final.\\n\\nto , On paper, both teams look evenly matched, with similar strengths in batting depth, all-rounders, and spin options. However, India’s slight advantage in familiarity with the conditions tilts the scales marginally in their favour. But this is a final, and nothing tests a team like the pressure of the big stage. New Zealand has been India’s nemesis in ICC tournaments before, and they will be eager to stamp their authority once again. Meanwhile, India, having been in this position multiple times, will know exactly what to expect and how to counter the nerves. The last time these two sides met in a Champions Trophy final was way back in 2000 when New Zealand got the better of India. Can they reclaim the trophy after 25 years? Or will India win back-to-back ICC white-ball titles and solidify their dominance? It’s all on the line, and the anticipation has reached a fever pitch! Stay tuned, as the all-important toss and team news are just moments away!\\n\\nto , A major strength of this New Zealand side is their right-left batting combinations, which have troubled opposition bowlers throughout the tournament. But if batting has been rock-solid, it’s their lethal pace attack that has truly unsettled teams. Matt Henry has been their spearhead, but concerns over his injury could be a major blow. If unavailable, it will put even more responsibility on the likes of Will O'Rourke and also Mitchell Santner, who will lead the spin attack in conditions that could favour slower bowlers.\\n\\nto , Standing in India’s way is a New Zealand side that has been exceptional throughout the tournament. Their only defeat came against India at this very venue, but if history has taught us anything, it’s that the Kiwis always bounce back stronger. New Zealand’s batting unit is formidable, led by the explosive Rachin Ravindra, who has been a revelation at the top. The ever-reliable Kane Williamson, who has been at the heart of many big-game battles, will bring his trademark composure and class to this final. Their middle order packs a punch, with Daryl Mitchell, Tom Latham and Glenn Phillips, all of whom have delivered in pressure situations.\\n\\nto , While much of the focus has been on Varun Chakaravarthy’s mystery spin, credit must also go to the rest of India's bowling attack, which has provided exceptional support. With four quality spinners in their arsenal, India are unlikely to make any changes to their winning combination. Mohammad Shami, returning from injury, has grown stronger with every passing game and will be eager to make his mark on the grandest stage. India’s X-factor? The depth in both batting and bowling. With big-match players like Virat Kohli and Hardik Pandya, who thrive under pressure, they will once again look to step up when it matters most.\\n\\nto , India enters its third consecutive ICC white-ball event final in the last 17 months, and the confidence from their T20 World Cup triumph in 2024 will serve as a major boost. Having played all their matches at this very venue, India hold a slight advantage when it comes to understanding the conditions. Their performances have been all-round and clinical, but they know they are up against an opponent that has given them tough nights in ICC knockouts before. The opening pair of Rohit Sharma and Shubman Gill will be key in setting the tone, providing the solid start that the in-form middle order can build upon. One of India's biggest strengths is their all-rounders, who have proven to be genuine match-winners.\\n\\nto , The stage is set, the stakes are at their peak, and the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 is about to reach its epic conclusion! After weeks of high-intensity cricket, two of the most consistent teams in ODI cricket will battle it out for the ultimate prize. It’s India vs New Zealand at the Dubai International Stadium, a fitting venue for what promises to be a blockbuster finale. The world will be tuned in as these two cricketing powerhouses go toe-to-toe for glory. Fair to say, these two teams have been the most deserving finalists, both boasting remarkable consistency on the grandest stage of world cricket. With multiple ICC final appearances in recent years, they know exactly what it takes to handle the pressure of a championship clash. And make no mistake - neither side will give an inch!\\n\\nto , ... MATCH DAY ...\\n\\nto , And then, there were two. Not the fiercest of rivals, but undoubtedly two of the most competitive teams on the field. You won’t find fiery sledges or heated banter here, just pure, unadulterated cricket at its finest. When these two stride out, you know you’re in for a display of skill, strategy, and sheer athleticism. These are two of the most consistent sides in ICC events in the recent past. Enough buildup? Maybe. But that’s exactly how the cricketing world feels right now. Two strong sides, mirror images of strength and determination, standing tall with everything on the line. The ICC Champions Trophy 2025 FINALE is here. In the blue corner, India, a nation’s heartbeat, ready to fight for a billion hopes. In the black corner, New Zealand, the quiet giants, always elevating their game in the ICC events, are poised to challenge. Both teams are storming into the final on the back of semifinal masterclasses, sharpening their swords. Where India defeated their nemesis Australia, a commanding show was put on by New Zealand to get over South Africa. The Men in Blue have faced their fair share of battles against the Blackcaps in recent years, be it the heartbreak of the 2019 World Cup semi-final, the sting of the 2021 WTC Final, or even the surprising 3-0 Test series loss at home. But when it comes to the big stage, records are just numbers. Rohit Sharma and Shubman Gill have set the tone at the top, with Rohit itching to turn his steady 30s and 40s into another ICC century, something he’s done more than anyone else in history. Then there’s Virat Kohli, the chase master, who thrives in these high-pressure events. He’s just a few runs away from overtaking Chris Gayle as the highest run-scorer in Champions Trophy history. Together, these two giants have been the backbone of India’s success in ICC events. And let’s not forget the middle order, which has been firing like a well-oiled machine. Shreyas Iyer, KL Rahul, Axar Patel, and Hardik Pandya, all have stepped up when called upon. But the real game-changer has been India’s bowling unit. No Bumrah? No problem. Varun Chakravarthy’s mystery spin has left batters guessing, while Mohammed Shami has led the pace attack with precision and fire. Ravindra Jadeja has been India’s silent weapon. With 20 wickets, he’s the highest wicket-taker for India in Champions Trophy history. But New Zealand? They’re no strangers and have navigated this territory time and again. Their batting order is oozing confidence, thanks to the consistent brilliance of Rachin Ravindra and the ever-dependable Kane Williamson. Since bursting onto the scene, Rachin has been a revelation for the Kiwis, delivering all-round performances that have turned heads. With two stunning centuries in this tournament, he’s emerged as the most consistent batter on display. And then there’s Williamson, the heart and soul of New Zealand’s batting in ICC events. No Kiwi has scored more runs in ICC tournaments than him, and he’s once again proving why he’s one of the modern greats. Leading the side for the first time in any big competition, Mitchell Santner’s captainship is being admired more than his bowling, which has equally been threatening. Miser with the economy, Santner has picked up seven wickets, and he stands joint-third to Chakravarthy. But the real star with the ball for New Zealand has been Matt Henry. Topping the wicket-taking charts with 10 scalps, he’s been the backbone of their attack. And he’s not alone, young Will O’Rourke has stepped up brilliantly, providing crucial support in the pace department. When you peel back the layers, the similarities between these two sides are uncanny, it’s like watching two masterpieces unfold in perfect harmony. At the top of the order, Rohit Sharma’s explosive batting sets the tone for India, but Rachin Ravindra’s adaptability to slot in anywhere gives New Zealand the same dynamic edge. Virat Kohli’s timeless class and ability to thrive under pressure are mirrored by Kane Williamson’s serene yet devastating touch. Both are maestros, crafting innings that feel like poetry in motion. If there’s Shreyas Iyer and KL Rahul’s flair, Will Young and Tom Latham are another class apart. In the field, Ravindra Jadeja’s athleticism and sharpness are world-class, but Glenn Phillips isn’t far behind, pulling off gravity-defying catches and saving crucial runs. Hardik Pandya’s all-round brilliance finds its match in Daryl Mitchell, who has repeatedly stepped up for the Kiwis with both bat and ball. And while Varun Chakravarthy’s mystery spin has left batters scratching their heads, Mitchell Santner’s subtle variations and control have been just as effective. With the ball, Mohammed Shami’s seam artistry has been a standout, but Matt Henry has been equally lethal, topping the wicket-taking charts with his precision and consistency. It’s hard to imagine two teams more evenly matched than these. The pitch? Remember the India-Pakistan game? Yep, that same surface will host this grand finale. Last time, 241 was the first-innings score, which tells you this isn’t going to be a high-scoring slugfest. It’s slow, it’s tricky, and it’s going to test the batters’ patience. Forget the big sixes and flashy strike rates, this is all about working the gaps, sprinting those singles, converting ones in twos, and keeping the scoreboard ticking. Both India and New Zealand have mastered the art of strike rotation, a mechanism that sets them apart and makes them perfectly suited for these conditions. Also, even with the ball. With the pitch likely to favor spin, India might lean on Kuldeep Yadav, who’s been in stellar form, along with Axar, Jadeja, and Varun as their other spinners, while New Zealand could stick with their three-spinner combo led by Santner. India has a marginal upper hand as they have played all their games in Dubai and have got enough rest time as well. New Zealand, on the other hand, may have some travel fatigue. Also, the last time these two sides met in the league match, in Dubai itself, India emerged victorious. That, too, was not a run-fest by any means. Can India avenge Nairobi’s upset? Or does New Zealand have their Cairns-Harris formula intact? Genuine cricketing fans would crack this in a snap. You know that feeling when your heart's in your throat and you're mentally negotiating with the cricket gods? Get ready for seven glorious hours of exactly that. New Zealand aims to break the deadlock of white-ball triumph in ICC events. Meanwhile, India is looking to rewrite its 50-over dominance. Add to this another twist, New Zealand has won two ICC championships to date - the Champions Trophy of 2000 and the ICC World Test Championship 2021. On both occasions, their opponent was India. That's enough for a teaser to the kind of weightage this clash holds. Sit back, and relax, a Sunday filled with a blend of emotions and patriotism awaits.\\n\\nto , The celebrations will go on in their camp until the break of dawn as the Men in Blue bask in the glory of their triumph. The Champions Trophy made its long-awaited return after 8 years, and it sure was an entertaining event. It has left an indelible mark on our memories, and as we bid adieu to the tournament, it's natural to experience withdrawal symptoms. We hope you enjoyed our coverage over the past few weeks as much as we enjoyed bringing everything to you. Until next time, take care and goodbye!\\n\\nto , The players of the Indian team are now invited onto the stage to collect their white jackets, a symbol of victory and distinction for the winners of the Champions Trophy.

On Varun Chakaravarthy, he mentions that he has something very different in him. Says when you are playing on such pitches, you want to have someone like him. Adds that he didn't start but played in the latter matches and got crucial wickets. Says luckily for them, it came to use, and they just wanted to maximise his abilities. On the fans, he again acknowledges them and feels grateful for their support. Says it makes a huge difference when they come out in large numbers to support them.\\n\\nto , Next up, the players of the runners-up team, New Zealand, are called up one by one to collect their medals. The Kiwi skipper, Mitchell Santner collects his medal, and he is now in for a chat. Santner acknowledges that they were beaten by a better side on the day, but he couldn’t have asked for more from the group as a captain. Mentions that it was challenging to start, but credits India for their approach. He feels that they were about 20-25 runs short, but the team’s fighting spirit was evident, and he is happy with the effort shown. Santner particularly highlights Rohit Sharma’s performance, saying the first Powerplay was the best time to bat, and Rohit was outstanding during that period. States that captaining New Zealand for the first time in an ICC event was very enjoyable. Adds that his job was made easier by different guys stepping up at different moments, and he can't thank the guys enough for that.\\n\\nto , First up, Aaron Finch is invited to place the trophy on the presentation podium.

Tells that all members of the squad have a part to play, also mentions that there isn't an established player nor a newbie and says they go about their business and play like a team.\\n\\nto , Rohit Sharma is the PLAYER OF THE MATCH for his knock of 76 runs off 83 balls which set the tone in the chase. He says they played some really good cricket throughout the tournament and to have the result in their favour feels very nice. Mentions that he gets the backing of the team to try and be different and he got the right support from Rahul Dravid back in the ODI World Cup and from Gautam here. States that having played at this venue, he understands the nature of the pitch and he tries to use his feet and has a clear mindset of how to target the first few overs. Adds that it sometimes gets him out but also gives them results like these. Mentions that he likes having this kind of batting depth, which gives them the confidence to go hard at the new ball up front.\\n\\nto , Time for the presentation ceremony...\\n\\nto , Virat Kohli joins in the conversation and begins by saying it's been amazing and says they wanted to bounce back after a tough Australia tour. Expresses his feelings and says it is lovely to play with such an amazing bunch of youngsters. Appreciates them for stepping up and taking this Indian team in the right direction.

Mentions that this win means a lot for him after playing for so long and winning big tournaments is what makes it all worthwhile.\\n\\nto , KL Rahul is in for a chat. He says that he was really nervous, but with a couple of batters still to come to bat, it was all about holding his composure. Says it's not easy, but is happy to do the job for the side. Adds that he has batted in times like these, three out of five times and it has given him the experience to play under such situations with good preparations. Says they had to soak in a lot of pressure and credits the BCCI and the domestic cricket for giving them the exposure to play this kind of cricket.\\n\\nto , Let's hear from a few players from the Indian camp...\\n\\nto , Earlier, Mitchell Santner called it right at the toss, and Rachin Ravindra got New Zealand off to a promising start. It all looked rosy for the Kiwis while Rachin was at the crease, but Kuldeep Yadav's double strike turned the tide. From there, India's spin quartet applied the squeeze with their accuracy. Daryl Mitchell fell for 63 just as he was starting to put the foot down but thanks to Michael Bracewell's 40-ball 53, the Black Caps reached 251. To add to his batting heroics, Bracewell chipped in with the ball as well, delivering remarkable figures of 10-1-28-2 but despite his efforts, New Zealand ended up on the losing side.\\n\\nto , With no Matt Henry to turn to at the death and with their two key spin weapons, Mitchell Santner and Michael Bracewell bowled out, New Zealand were left with few options to apply more pressure on India. Given the solid start India had, the run rate was never much of an issue. Instead, it was the pressure of the final that loomed large. However, KL Rahul provided the calming influence India needed and he saw it through to the end.\\n\\nto , One wicket brought two for New Zealand as Virat Kohli fell cheaply, and from there, they began tightening the screws, with the ball spinning more than it did in the first innings. The pressure eventually got to Rohit Sharma, and from a commanding 105/0, India suddenly found themselves wobbling at 122/3. Shreyas Iyer and Axar Patel manoeuvred the strike expertly against the Kiwi spinners, bringing some calmness to the chase. However, the door was once again open as both fell after getting a start, leaving India with more work to do in their pursuit of 252.\\n\\nto , The Kiwis were without the ever-reliable Matt Henry to set the tone in their defence of 251, and his absence was felt as Rohit Sharma took the attack to them. He threw caution to the wind, while Shubman Gill played the supporting role. The Black Caps needed a moment of inspiration to break the flourishing opening stand, and it came from Glenn Phillips, adding another stunner to his highlights reel.\\n\\nto , A game truly worthy of being called a final, where the pendulum swung one way and then the other, but ultimately, India have prevailed in a tense chase. The Men in Blue are the deserving winners of the 2025 Champions Trophy. After faltering at the final hurdle in 2017, they have now accomplished their mission and reclaimed the title. Despair for New Zealand, but they can hold their heads high after a spirited campaign that saw them battle fiercely till the very end, something you expect from any Kiwi side, never willing to back down.\\n\\n49\\n\\nover\\n\\n49 | 9 Runs | HH: 254/6\\n\\n48.6\\n\\nWill O'Rourke to Ravindra Jadeja, FOUR!

Back of a length, well outside off, Ravindra Jadeja looks to cut but only manages to get an under-edge that falls in front of backward point and sets himself off for the run. Is sent back at the right time by KL. The fielder charges in, scoops it up and scores a direct hit with an underarm throw at the batting end.\\n\\n47.5\\n\\nKyle Jamieson to Ravindra Jadeja, Kyle Jamieson drops it short and on off, a bit too predictable at the moment. Ravindra Jadeja waits and pulls it to deep backward square leg for a couple more.\\n\\n47.4\\n\\nKyle Jamieson to Ravindra Jadeja, Back of a length, angling into the batter, Ravindra Jadeja hops back and tucks it to deep backward square leg.

Kyle Jamieson digs it short and on off, Hardik Pandya looks to pull it from above his head but only manages to get a top edge that skews straight up. Kyle Jamieson on his follow-through takes a few steps ahead, settles under and takes a simple catch to get his first wicket of the game. Hardik Pandya departs for 18 (18). India are 241/6, needing 11 runs from 15 balls.\\n\\n47.2\\n\\nKyle Jamieson to Hardik Pandya, Great ball! Short and outside off, climbs on the batter in a flash. Hardik Pandya initially looks to pull but withdraws the shot and drops his wrists down.\\n\\n47.1\\n\\nKyle Jamieson to KL Rahul, Back of a good length, just outside off, KL Rahul looks to work it through the off side and plays close to the body.

India need 12 runs off 18 balls.\\n\\n46.5\\n\\nWill O'Rourke to KL Rahul, A comedy of errors, but KL Rahul manages to sneak his bat in time. On a length, angling into the pads, KL Rahul tickles it to fine leg and sets off for the second. Hardik Pandya stops and sends him back but KL is more than halfway through the second run and Pandya decides to charge to the other end. The throw is fired in at the batting end where Tom Latham flicks the bails off and throws the ball to the bowler who does the same at the other end but both batters make it in.\\n\\n46.4\\n\\nWill O'Rourke to Hardik Pandya, Will O'Rourke goes full and attacks the stumps, Hardik Pandya angles the bat face and drives it to deep cover for one.\\n\\n46.3\\n\\nWill O'Rourke to Hardik Pandya, FOUR!

India need 21 more runs off 24 balls.\\n\\n45.6\\n\\nRachin Ravindra to Hardik Pandya, TWO WIDES! That's the last thing New Zealand wanted at this moment! Rachin slips it beyond the tramline on off and Tom Latham fails to collect it cleanly to his right. The ball goes past him and the batters sneak a run. Rachin Ravindra looks surprisingly at the umpire as he thinks the ball was inside the tramline.\\n\\n45.5\\n\\nRachin Ravindra to KL Rahul, Full, on middle, KL Rahul drives it to long on for one.\\n\\n45.4\\n\\nRachin Ravindra to KL Rahul, Lovely ball! Keeps it tight, on off, on a nagging length, KL Rahul makes room to ease it through covers but fails to free his arms enough. Chips it down the deck.\\n\\n45.3\\n\\nRachin Ravindra to Hardik Pandya, Slower through the air, a tad short of a length, on off, Hardik Pandya looks to cut but chops it in front of point. The batters scamper across for the run.\\n\\n45.2\\n\\nRachin Ravindra to Hardik Pandya, Full and on off, Hardik Pandya backs away a bit and thumps it to cover.\\n\\n45.1\\n\\nRachin Ravindra to Hardik Pandya, SIX! MONSTROUS! Hardik Pandya sees it in the slot, clears his front leg, and sends it soaring over the bowler's head for a towering six. Another over that starts with a boundary.

India need 32 more runs off 30 balls.\\n\\n44.5\\n\\nWill O'Rourke to Hardik Pandya, Bangs it very short and outside off, Hardik Pandya lets it pass hoping for it to be called a wide but it isn't. Two solid dots from Will O'Rourke!\\n\\n44.4\\n\\nWill O'Rourke to Hardik Pandya, Short of a length, angling into the hips, Hardik Pandya hops back and tucks it to mid-wicket. New Zealand need more of these dots now.\\n\\n44.3\\n\\nWill O'Rourke to KL Rahul, On a hard length, on off, KL Rahul hangs back and punches it through cover-point for one.\\n\\n44.2\\n\\nWill O'Rourke to KL Rahul, Hits the length right but keeps it outside off, KL Rahul steers it past backward point and picks up two more runs. 6 off the first two balls.\\n\\n44.1\\n\\nWill O'Rourke to KL Rahul, FOUR!

Rachin Ravindra might as well want to try and push it fuller.\\n\\n43.3\\n\\nRachin Ravindra to KL Rahul, Drops it very short and on off, KL Rahul reaches for it and punches it to deep cover for one.\\n\\n43.2\\n\\nRachin Ravindra to KL Rahul, Keeps it full and on off, KL Rahul takes a good stride out and guides it to point. Valuable dot!\\n\\n43.1\\n\\nRachin Ravindra to Hardik Pandya, Comes from around the wicket and tosses it up, full and on leg, Hardik Pandya drives it to long on for a single.\\n\\nto , Rachin Ravindra returns to the attack. 8-1-30-1 so far for Rachin.\\n\\n43\\n\\nover\\n\\n43 | 3 Runs | HH: 206/5\\n\\n42.6\\n\\nMitchell Santner to KL Rahul, Pushed through, fuller and on the stumps, KL Rahul leans on it and blocks it out. Mitchell Santner wraps his spell with a dot, and concedes just three runs off it. The Kiwi skipper finishes with extremely economical figures of 10-0-46-2. India need 46 more runs to win from 42 deliveries.\\n\\n42.5\\n\\nMitchell Santner to KL Rahul, Length-delivery, around off, pushed to the cover-point region.\\n\\n42.5\\n\\nMitchell Santner to KL Rahul, WIDE!

IN THE AIR AND TAKEN! A brain fade moment for Axar Patel and he throws his wicket away! New Zealand keep chipping in with crucial wickets as Michael Bracewell provides yet another breakthrough! He has been excellent through and through! Lures the Indian left-hander in the flight, does Michael, and drops the ball on a fullish length, just around off. Axar Patel gets a bit greedy and tries to take on the flight. Tries to hit it too hard and loses his shape a bit, and ends up slicing it up in the air. The ball dips ahead of the long off fielder and it is taken sharply by Will O'Rourke. Axar falls for 29 (40) with India needing 49 runs in 51 balls.\\n\\n41.2\\n\\nMichael Bracewell to KL Rahul, Sliding on the pads, on a fuller length, KL Rahul flicks it past mid-wicket, beating Glenn Phillips' dive to his right, for a single.\\n\\n41.1\\n\\nMichael Bracewell to KL Rahul, Fuller and on middle, KL Rahul flicks it to square leg.\\n\\n41\\n\\nover\\n\\n41 | 11 Runs | HH: 202/4\\n\\n40.6\\n\\nMitchell Santner to KL Rahul, Serves it right up, full and on middle, KL Rahul clips it with soft hands and along the ground to the vacant mid-wicket region. With no fielder there in the ring, Mitchell Santner sprints towards the ball, but the batters run a single in the meanwhile.\\n\\n40.5\\n\\nMitchell Santner to KL Rahul, Back of a length, turning away from off, KL Rahul creates room and punches it strongly towards the cover region. A fumble there by the fielder allows the batters to hustle back for the double. The 200 is up for India now.\\n\\n40.4\\n\\nMitchell Santner to KL Rahul, SIX! A pressure-releasing shot for KL Rahul! It is a shot he plays really well! Flighted up, on a fullish length, on the leg stump line, KL Rahul takes his front foot out of the way, allows the ball to come to him and thumps it behind long on for a six.\\n\\n40.3\\n\\nMitchell Santner to Axar Patel, Flatter and on off, on a length, Axar Patel backs away, creates some room and punches it towards long off for one.\\n\\n40.2\\n\\nMitchell Santner to Axar Patel, Tosses the ball up, on a length, outside off, tucked across to the mid-wicket fielder.\\n\\n40.1\\n\\nMitchell Santner to KL Rahul, Dropped fuller and on middle, KL Rahul pushes it inside out to the cover region and steals a single.\\n\\nto , End of Powerplay 2!

Just a single! Fuller delivery around off and middle, Axar Patel works it to the mid-wicket fielder. 61 needed off the last 10 overs now.\\n\\n39.5\\n\\nMichael Bracewell to KL Rahul, Oh, a risky single! Completed eventually! Slower, fuller and on middle and leg, Rahul clips it to the square leg region. Axar Patel first hesitates but pushes harder for the single and gets to the other end before the throw.\\n\\n39.4\\n\\nMichael Bracewell to KL Rahul, Make that four dots in a row! Back of a length, on the stumps, KL Rahul punches it back to the bowler to his right.\\n\\n39.3\\n\\nMichael Bracewell to KL Rahul, And suddenly, three dot balls on the trot! Back of a length, angling on the leg stump, KL Rahul backs away and eases it to cover.\\n\\n39.2\\n\\nMichael Bracewell to KL Rahul, Floated fuller and on off, KL Rahul whips it across to mid-wicket.\\n\\n39.1\\n\\nMichael Bracewell to KL Rahul, Drag down, flat and on top of middle, KL Rahul punches it back to the bowler.\\n\\n39\\n\\nover\\n\\n39 | 7 Runs | HH: 190/4\\n\\n38.6\\n\\nMitchell Santner to Axar Patel, SIX! Just clears the ropes! Axar with some intent now! Santner drops a loopy delivery, on a fullish length, around off and middle. Axar Patel sits on his knee and picks it up well. Slogs it behind and over the leaping deep square leg fielder for a six. 62 needed off the last 66 deliveries. This game has zigzagged at a dramatic pace so far.\\n\\n38.5\\n\\nMitchell Santner to KL Rahul, Floated fuller and outside off, KL Rahul drives it inside out to deep cover for a single.\\n\\nto , KL Rahul walks in at number 6 for India.\\n\\n38.4\\n\\nMitchell Santner to Shreyas Iyer, OUT! IN THE AIR AND TAKEN! Straight after the hydration break, Mitchell Santner, the Kiwi skipper, strikes gold! Santner keeps the stumps into play and bowls it closer to the body of the batter on a length. Shreyas Iyer gets a bit across to pull it over the backward square leg fielder, but plays it way closer to the body and hence, does not get the power, nor the height. Rachin Ravindra comes swooping in with the dive to his left and takes a fantastic diving catch. Shreyas Iyer departs for 48 (62) and India are 183/4, needing 69 more runs to win off 68 deliveries.\\n\\n38.3\\n\\nMitchell Santner to Shreyas Iyer, More flight given, fuller and around off, Iyer drills it to cover.\\n\\n38.2\\n\\nMitchell Santner to Shreyas Iyer, Slides on the pads, on a length, Iyer tries to whip across but inside edges on the thigh pad.\\n\\n38.1\\n\\nMitchell Santner to Shreyas Iyer, Flights it fuller and around off, Shreyas Iyer eases it to the cover fielder.\\n\\nto , Drinks Break! Phew! What a thrilling phase of play! India have weathered the storm after losing quick wickets, thanks to the ever-reliable Shreyas Iyer, who has once again stepped up, with solid support from Axar Patel. With just 69 runs needed off 72 balls, India, armed with batting depth, will feel confident they’re on course for victory. New Zealand has been disciplined with the ball, but that costly dropped catch of Shreyas Iyer by Kyle Jamieson might come back to haunt them. They desperately need wickets now to shift the momentum and crank up the pressure! Mitchell Santner comes back into the attack now. Can he break this stand?\\n\\n38\\n\\nover\\n\\n38 | 7 Runs | HH: 183/3\\n\\n37.6\\n\\nWill O'Rourke to Axar Patel, Length-delivery, around off, Axar Patel punches it to the mid off region. Iyer sniffs a single and takes the charge, but is sent back by Axar as Mitchell Santner scoots to his left and picks and throws in a motion towards the bowling end. Scores a direct hit, but Shreyas Iyer is safely back inside the crease. The umpires do not go upstairs to check for a run out.\\n\\n37.5\\n\\nWill O'Rourke to Axar Patel, FOUR! Timed to perfection! Back of a length, angling into the body, Axar Patel stands tall and short-arm jabs it, beating the diving mid on fielder to his left for a boundary. His first boundary in 34 balls he faced.\\n\\n37.4\\n\\nWill O'Rourke to Axar Patel, Fired on a good length, on top of middle, Axar Patel tucks it across to mid-wicket.\\n\\n37.3\\n\\nWill O'Rourke to Shreyas Iyer, Short and climbing on the batter, outside off, Shreyas Iyer half-pulls it over square leg for a single.\\n\\n37.2\\n\\nWill O'Rourke to Axar Patel, Good length, around the hips, Axar glances it away to deep backward square leg for a single.\\n\\n37.1\\n\\nWill O'Rourke to Shreyas Iyer, Back of a length, nipping back in, around off, Shreyas Iyer waits for it and dabs it with soft hands to deep third for a single.\\n\\n37\\n\\nover\\n\\n37 | 10 Runs | HH: 176/3\\n\\n36.6\\n\\nGlenn Phillips to Shreyas Iyer, Full and fired on middle, Shreyas Iyer pushes it down to long on for a single.\\n\\n36.5\\n\\nGlenn Phillips to Axar Patel, Length and at the pads. Axar tucks it to deep square leg for a single.\\n\\n36.4\\n\\nGlenn Phillips to Shreyas Iyer, PUT DOWN! OH, KYLE JAMIESON! Hands on heads for the Kiwis here! Full and quick, on middle and leg, Shreyas Iyer mistimes it in the air off the toe-end of the bat, towards long on. Kyle Jamieson loses the ball in the ring of fire and by the time he could grab it, it was too late and runs a bit too far forward as well. He tries to grab it around his chest level, but shells one sitter here and the batters cross for one. A key moment in the finale. It hasn't been a good day in the field for both sides. Also, not at all by the standards both sides pose in the fielding department either.\\n\\n36.3\\n\\nGlenn Phillips to Shreyas Iyer, SIX! This will ease the pressure enormously off his shoulders! Also, the 50-run stand is up between these two! Glenn Phillips serves right into the wheelhouse of the right-hander, a juicy half-volley on off, Shreyas Iyer sits down on his knee and slogs it behind deep mid-wicket for a six.\\n\\n36.2\\n\\nGlenn Phillips to Shreyas Iyer, Over the stumps now. Flat, and on a length, around off, Iyer backs away and punches it back to GP.\\n\\n36.1\\n\\nGlenn Phillips to Axar Patel, Around the stumps, tossed up, fuller and outside leg, Axar Patel drills it down to long on for a single.\\n\\n36\\n\\nover\\n\\n36 | 5 Runs | HH: 166/3\\n\\n35.6\\n\\nWill O'Rourke to Shreyas Iyer, Short again, on off, Iyer rises with the bounce and helps the pull to the right of deep square leg for a couple of runs.\\n\\n35.5\\n\\nWill O'Rourke to Axar Patel, Dug in short by Will, on off, Axar presses back to take the short ball on. Does not connect it well but hits it away from deep square leg to his right for a single.\\n\\n35.4\\n\\nWill O'Rourke to Axar Patel, Slanting into the pads, on a length, Axar whips it sweetly but cannot get it past mid-wicket.\\n\\n35.3\\n\\nWill O'Rourke to Shreyas Iyer, On a short of a good length, around off, Iyer waits back and runs it down to deep third for one.\\n\\n35.2\\n\\nWill O'Rourke to Axar Patel, Will bashes the hard length, over middle, Axar hops and jabs it in front of mid on for a quick single.\\n\\n35.1\\n\\nWill O'Rourke to Axar Patel, Begins from around the wicket and lands it on a good length, on off, Axar is a bit rushed in the shot as he looks to play it on the up. Miscues it towards mid on.\\n\\nto , Change of pace. Will O'Rourke (2-0-18-0) is into the attack now. He replaces Michael Bracewell.\\n\\n35\\n\\nover\\n\\n35 | 2 Runs | HH: 161/3\\n\\n34.6\\n\\nGlenn Phillips to Shreyas Iyer, Slightly fuller, on off, Iyer dabs it with an open bat face in front of backward point. He wants to sneak in a quick single but Axar says no. A good quiet over for New Zealand. Just 2 runs off it.\\n\\n34.5\\n\\nGlenn Phillips to Shreyas Iyer, Pushed through, flat and short, on middle and leg, Iyer goes deep in the crease and turns it to mid-wicket.\\n\\n34.4\\n\\nGlenn Phillips to Axar Patel, A bit quicker this time, on off, Axar pats this short ball down the deck. Glenn moves to his left but fails to make the stop and concedes a single.\\n\\n34.3\\n\\nGlenn Phillips to Shreyas Iyer, Drops it short, on off, Iyer stands tall and punches it down to long on for one.\\n\\n34.2\\n\\nGlenn Phillips to Shreyas Iyer, On a nagging length, around off, Shreyas drops it in front of backward point and sets off for a run before being sent back by Axar.\\n\\n34.1\\n\\nGlenn Phillips to Shreyas Iyer, Play and a miss! Short and outside off, this skids through, Iyer makes room for the cut but gets beaten. Hands on heads for Glenn.\\n\\nto , Is Santner keeping himself away from the attack because of the left-hander at the crease? He and Michael Bracewell kept things really tight, bowling in tandem and made the Indian batters work extremely hard for runs. But ever since Glenn Phillips has come to bowl, singles have come at ease. Shreyas Iyer has been good with the strike rotation and those singles will start to hurt New Zealand a bit more if they don't get a wicket sooner. And with that, GP gets another over.\\n\\n34\\n\\nover\\n\\n34 | 5 Runs | HH: 159/3\\n\\n33.6\\n\\nMichael Bracewell to Shreyas Iyer, This spins back in, short and on middle, Iyer goes back and across in the crease and plays it wide of cover for one more. India need 93 runs from 96 balls.\\n\\n33.5\\n\\nMichael Bracewell to Axar Patel, Short and outside off, cut away to deep point for another single.\\n\\n33.4\\n\\nMichael Bracewell to Axar Patel, Looped up, full and at the stumps, Axar pushes it back to Bracewell.\\n\\n33.3\\n\\nMichael Bracewell to Shreyas Iyer, Slows it down and offers flight, on off, Iyer gets nice and low and pats it wide of cover for one more.\\n\\n33.2\\n\\nMichael Bracewell to Axar Patel, Floated up, on off, on a length, Axar drives it wide of cover and crosses over.\\n\\n33.1\\n\\nMichael Bracewell to Shreyas Iyer, At 88.8 kph, on a length, on middle and leg, Iyer helps it down to deep fine leg for a single.\\n\\n33\\n\\nover\\n\\n33 | 9 Runs | HH: 154/3\\n\\n32.6\\n\\nGlenn Phillips to Shreyas Iyer, A bit of drift away, on off, fuller in length, Iyer leans forward and works it towards short third for one more run. 9 runs off the over.\\n\\n32.5\\n\\nGlenn Phillips to Shreyas Iyer, FOUR!

No, it is that man called Glenn Phillips! Another blinder of a catch from him. He caught Mohammad Rizwan first, then Virat Kohli, and now plucks the catch of Shubman Gill out of thin air. That was meant to be travelling to the ropes, but the Kiwi was alert enough to grab it. Dropped too full and around off, Shubman Gill tries to loft it over the cover fielder but doesn't quite get the connection right. Hits it flat and over Glenn Phillips at cover. GP throws himself up in the air and sticks his right hand out. Snaffles the ball, while being airborne, tumbles on the ground but maintains the ball in his hands.

With the opening stand soaring to 103 runs, Rohit Sharma is in blistering touch, unleashing a masterclass of aggression and putting New Zealand on high alert. Shubman Gill, after a cautious start, has now hit his stride too, adding to the Kiwis' woes. The introduction of spin has slowed the scoring by a bit, but the Kiwi bowlers have failed to apply sustained pressure with dot balls. India are in complete control at the moment, dictating the game with ease. New Zealand need quick wickets and need them right away because this match is slipping through their fingers at an alarming pace.\\n\\n18\\n\\nover\\n\\n18 | 3 Runs | HH: 103/0\\n\\n17.6\\n\\nRachin Ravindra to Rohit Sharma, Length, slightly outside off, Rohit plays it late, opens the bat face and eases it out to the point region.\\n\\n17.5\\n\\nRachin Ravindra to Shubman Gill, Good work in the deep by Will O'Rourke!

The pre-tournament favourite team or an athlete winning a title could be taken for granted while failure could attract intense criticism. India was in this unenviable situation.\\n\\nBut over the last three weeks, the Men in Blue have gone about their business clinically and methodically to emerge triumphant after beating New Zealand by four wickets in a pulsating summit clash at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium on Sunday.\\n\\nThe victory, though, did not come easy. India had one of the most balanced squad in the competition, and the flexibility and depth in every position was unparalleled. Against a dogged Black Caps unit, Rohit Sharma’s men had to dig into the last ounce of talent in its dugout to cross the final hurdle.\\n\\nIn pursuit of 252, Rohit (76) took the bull by its horns and pulled the second ball of the chase from Kyle Jamieson for a six.\\n\\nOver the next hour, in a stroke-filled display of power-hitting, he charged down to the pacers, smashed forcefully through the off-side and even brought out the lap-shot en route his first half-century of the competition.\\n\\nAlso read | Virat Kohli’s reaction after India’s win in Champions Trophy final\")"

Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \\n\\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \\n\\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \\n\\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \\n\\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \\n\\nSix days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \\n\\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \\n\\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \\n\\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \\n\\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.\\nSource: 0-pl\\nContent: And we won’t stop. \\n\\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \\n\\nLet’s use this moment to reset. Let’s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \\n\\nLet’s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \\n\\nWe can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \\n\\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \\n\\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \\n\\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \\n\\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \\n\\nBoth Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \\n\\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.\\nSource: 24-pl\\nContent: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \\n\\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I’ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \\n\\nAnd I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia’s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \\n\\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \\n\\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \\n\\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what’s happening can seem alarming. \\n\\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.\\nSource: 5-pl\\nContent: More support for patients and families. \\n\\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \\n\\nIt’s based on DARPA—the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \\n\\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose—to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and more. \\n\\nA unity agenda for the nation. \\n\\nWe can do this. \\n\\nMy fellow Americans—tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space—the citadel of our democracy. \\n\\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \\n\\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \\n\\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \\n\\nNow is the hour. \\n\\nOur moment of responsibility. \\n\\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \\n\\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged. \\n\\nWell I know this nation.\\nSource: 34-pl\\n=========\\nFINAL ANSWER: The president did not mention Michael Jackson.\\nSOURCES:\\n\\nQUESTION: {question}\\n=========\\n{summaries}\\n=========\\nFINAL ANSWER:'), llm=ChatGroq(client=<groq.resources.chat.completions.Completions object at 0x00000228AEEFFA40>, async_client=<groq.resources.chat.completions.AsyncCompletions object at 0x00000228AF36F0E0>, model_name='llama3-70b-8192', temperature=0.5, model_kwargs={}, groq_api_key=SecretStr('**********')), output_parser=StrOutputParser(), llm_kwargs={}), document_prompt=PromptTemplate(input_variables=['page_content', 'source'], input_types={}, partial_variables={}, template='Content: {page_content}\\nSource: {source}'), document_variable_name='summaries')), document_variable_name='context'), retriever=VectorStoreRetriever(tags=['FAISS', 'HuggingFaceEmbeddings'], vectorstore=<langchain_community.vectorstores.faiss.FAISS object at 0x00000228FA7C78F0>, search_kwargs={}))"

      "      \"context\": \"to , And then, there were two. Not the fiercest of rivals, but undoubtedly two of the most competitive teams on the field. You won’t find fiery sledges or heated banter here, just pure, unadulterated cricket at its finest. When these two stride out, you know you’re in for a display of skill, strategy, and sheer athleticism. These are two of the most consistent sides in ICC events in the recent past. Enough buildup? Maybe. But that’s exactly how the cricketing world feels right now. Two strong sides, mirror images of strength and determination, standing tall with everything on the line. The ICC Champions Trophy 2025 FINALE is here. In the blue corner, India, a nation’s heartbeat, ready to fight for a billion hopes. In the black corner, New Zealand, the quiet giants, always elevating their game in the ICC events, are poised to challenge. Both teams are storming into the final on the back of semifinal masterclasses, sharpening their swords. Where India defeated their nemesis Australia, a commanding show was put on by New Zealand to get over South Africa. The Men in Blue have faced their fair share of battles against the Blackcaps in recent years, be it the heartbreak of the 2019 World Cup semi-final, the sting of the 2021 WTC Final, or even the surprising 3-0 Test series loss at home. But when it comes to the big stage, records are just numbers. Rohit Sharma and Shubman Gill have set the tone at the top, with Rohit itching to turn his steady 30s and 40s into another ICC century, something he’s done more than anyone else in history. Then there’s Virat Kohli, the chase master, who thrives in these high-pressure events. He’s just a few runs away from overtaking Chris Gayle as the highest run-scorer in Champions Trophy history. Together, these two giants have been the backbone of India’s success in ICC events. And let’s not forget the middle order, which has been firing like a well-oiled machine. Shreyas Iyer, KL Rahul, Axar Patel, and Hardik Pandya, all have stepped up when called upon. But the real game-changer has been India’s bowling unit. No Bumrah? No problem. Varun Chakravarthy’s mystery spin has left batters guessing, while Mohammed Shami has led the pace attack with precision and fire. Ravindra Jadeja has been India’s silent weapon. With 20 wickets, he’s the highest wicket-taker for India in Champions Trophy history. But New Zealand? They’re no strangers and have navigated this territory time and again. Their batting order is oozing confidence, thanks to the consistent brilliance of Rachin Ravindra and the ever-dependable Kane Williamson. Since bursting onto the scene, Rachin has been a revelation for the Kiwis, delivering all-round performances that have turned heads. With two stunning centuries in this tournament, he’s emerged as the most consistent batter on display. And then there’s Williamson, the heart and soul of New Zealand’s batting in ICC events. No Kiwi has scored more runs in ICC tournaments than him, and he’s once again proving\",\n",

The pre-tournament favourite team or an athlete winning a title could be taken for granted while failure could attract intense criticism. India was in this unenviable situation.\\n\\nBut over the last three weeks, the Men in Blue have gone about their business clinically and methodically to emerge triumphant after beating New Zealand by four wickets in a pulsating summit clash at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium on Sunday.\\n\\nThe victory, though, did not come easy. India had one of the most balanced squad in the competition, and the flexibility and depth in every position was unparalleled. Against a dogged Black Caps unit, Rohit Sharma’s men had to dig into the last ounce of talent in its dugout to cross the final hurdle.\\n\\nIn pursuit of 252, Rohit (76) took the bull by its horns and pulled the second ball of the chase from Kyle Jamieson for a six.\\n\\nOver the next hour, in a stroke-filled display of power-hitting, he charged down to the pacers, smashed forcefully through the off-side and even brought out the lap-shot en route his first half-century of the competition.\\n\\nAlso read | Virat Kohli’s reaction after India’s win in Champions Trophy final\",\n",

Not the fiercest of rivals, but undoubtedly two of the most competitive teams on the field. You won’t find fiery sledges or heated banter here, just pure, unadulterated cricket at its finest. When these two stride out, you know you’re in for a display of skill, strategy, and sheer athleticism. These are two of the most consistent sides in ICC events in the recent past. Enough buildup? Maybe. But that’s exactly how the cricketing world feels right now. Two strong sides, mirror images of strength and determination, standing tall with everything on the line. The ICC Champions Trophy 2025 FINALE is here. In the blue corner, India, a nation’s heartbeat, ready to fight for a billion hopes. In the black corner, New Zealand, the quiet giants, always elevating their game in the ICC events, are poised to challenge. Both teams are storming into the final on the back of semifinal masterclasses, sharpening their swords. Where India defeated their nemesis Australia, a commanding show was put on by New Zealand to get over South Africa. The Men in Blue have faced their fair share of battles against the Blackcaps in recent years, be it the heartbreak of the 2019 World Cup semi-final, the sting of the 2021 WTC Final, or even the surprising 3-0 Test series loss at home. But when it comes to the big stage, records are just numbers. Rohit Sharma and Shubman Gill have set the tone at the top, with Rohit itching to turn his steady 30s and 40s into another ICC century, something he’s done more than anyone else in history. Then there’s Virat Kohli, the chase master, who thrives in these high-pressure events. He’s just a few runs away from overtaking Chris Gayle as the highest run-scorer in Champions Trophy history. Together, these two giants have been the backbone of India’s success in ICC events. And let’s not forget the middle order, which has been firing like a well-oiled machine. Shreyas Iyer, KL Rahul, Axar Patel, and Hardik Pandya, all have stepped up when called upon. But the real game-changer has been India’s bowling unit. No Bumrah? No problem. Varun Chakravarthy’s mystery spin has left batters guessing, while Mohammed Shami has led the pace attack with precision and fire. Ravindra Jadeja has been India’s silent weapon. With 20 wickets, he’s the highest wicket-taker for India in Champions Trophy history. But New Zealand? They’re no strangers and have navigated this territory time and again. Their batting order is oozing confidence, thanks to the consistent brilliance of Rachin Ravindra and the ever-dependable Kane Williamson. Since bursting onto the scene, Rachin has been a revelation for the Kiwis, delivering all-round performances that have turned heads. With two stunning centuries in this tournament, he’s emerged as the most consistent batter on display. And then there’s Williamson, the heart and soul of New Zealand’s batting in ICC events. No Kiwi has scored more runs in ICC tournaments than him, and he’s once again proving\\nQuestion: Who won the ICC Champions Trophy 2025?\\nRelevant text, if any:\"\n",

The pre-tournament favourite team or an athlete winning a title could be taken for granted while failure could attract intense criticism. India was in this unenviable situation.\\n\\nBut over the last three weeks, the Men in Blue have gone about their business clinically and methodically to emerge triumphant after beating New Zealand by four wickets in a pulsating summit clash at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium on Sunday.\\n\\nThe victory, though, did not come easy. India had one of the most balanced squad in the competition, and the flexibility and depth in every position was unparalleled. Against a dogged Black Caps unit, Rohit Sharma’s men had to dig into the last ounce of talent in its dugout to cross the final hurdle.\\n\\nIn pursuit of 252, Rohit (76) took the bull by its horns and pulled the second ball of the chase from Kyle Jamieson for a six.\\n\\nOver the next hour, in a stroke-filled display of power-hitting, he charged down to the pacers, smashed forcefully through the off-side and even brought out the lap-shot en route his first half-century of the competition.\\n\\nAlso read | Virat Kohli’s reaction after India’s win in Champions Trophy final\\nQuestion: Who won the ICC Champions Trophy 2025?\\nRelevant text, if any:\"\n",

Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \\n\\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \\n\\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \\n\\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \\n\\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \\n\\nSix days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \\n\\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \\n\\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \\n\\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \\n\\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.\\nSource: 0-pl\\nContent: And we won’t stop. \\n\\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \\n\\nLet’s use this moment to reset. Let’s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \\n\\nLet’s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \\n\\nWe can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \\n\\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \\n\\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \\n\\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \\n\\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \\n\\nBoth Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \\n\\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.\\nSource: 24-pl\\nContent: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \\n\\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I’ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \\n\\nAnd I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia’s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \\n\\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \\n\\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \\n\\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what’s happening can seem alarming. \\n\\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.\\nSource: 5-pl\\nContent: More support for patients and families. \\n\\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \\n\\nIt’s based on DARPA—the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \\n\\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose—to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and more. \\n\\nA unity agenda for the nation. \\n\\nWe can do this. \\n\\nMy fellow Americans—tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space—the citadel of our democracy. \\n\\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \\n\\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \\n\\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \\n\\nNow is the hour. \\n\\nOur moment of responsibility. \\n\\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \\n\\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed.
